                    <font size="5px"> K</font>arnataka government and employee unions are in conflict over a new proposal to increase the working hours for IT employees to over 12 hours a day. The proposal is part of a broader set of amendments to labor laws in the state, aiming to make Karnataka more attractive for manufacturing investments and enhance its competitiveness globally.
                    Key changes in the labor laws include:Increasing the maximum daily work hours from 9 to 12, while maintaining a weekly cap of 48 hours.Allowing women to work night shifts, with provisions for safety and consent.Raising the limit for overtime hours from 75 to 145 hours per quarter.These amendments are part of the Karnataka government's efforts to attract foreign investments and integrate into global supply chains, similar to practices in China and Southeast Asian countries. Major industry players like Apple and Foxconn have been supportive of these changes, seeing them as crucial for large-scale manufacturing operations in the state​ (India Briefing)​​ (mint)​.However, these changes have sparked significant opposition from labor unions, who argue that the extended hours will harm worker health and well-being. Unions describe the proposal as an "attempt to impose slavery," emphasizing that such measures prioritize business interests over worker rights. The opposition parties and some members within the governing party have also voiced concerns, calling the amendments anti-labor​ (The News Minute)​​ (greythr)​.
                    The Karnataka government maintains that these changes are voluntary and aim to provide flexibility for both employers and employees, insisting that it does not enforce 12-hour workdays but facilitates agreements between industries and labor​.​

                    <font size="5px">A</font>s the Budget Session begins in India, the opposition parties are gearing up to challenge the government. Mamata Banerjee, leader of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), and Akhilesh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party (SP), recently addressed a rally where they criticized the stability of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Both leaders emphasized the need for a new political front to oppose the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
                    Akhilesh Yadav stated that a new alliance, which he referred to as a "gathbandhan" or front, is likely to emerge before the elections. This alliance aims to bring about "parivartan" or change, by uniting various regional parties against the BJP.<br><img src="news2.jpg" height="200px" width="300px"> <font size="5">H</font>owever, Yadav made it clear that this new front would not include the Congress, suggesting a strategic distance from both the Congress and the BJP.
                    Mamata Banerjee echoed this sentiment, highlighting the need for strong regional alliances. She has previously held similar meetings with other regional leaders, including Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and former Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, to discuss maintaining equidistance from the BJP and Congress. This indicates her strategy to build a robust opposition front with regional parties that have significant influence in their respective states.
                    The efforts by Banerjee and Yadav reflect a broader movement among opposition parties to present a united front against the BJP in the 2024 elections. These developments are seen as crucial steps in mobilizing support and strategizing for a major electoral battle ahead​ (Hindustan Times)​​ (India Today)​​ (India Today)​​ (Business Today)​.</td>
